# Raft implementation
What is the better way to understand Raft Consensus Algorithm than implementing it from scratch.

# TODO
- test ApplyCommittedEntries
- test AddCommand to 100% coverage
- testing follower AppendEntry w/ 100% coverage
- testing follower RequestVoteFollower w/ 100% coverage
- testing leader w/ 100% coverage
- refactor states directly to RaftNode
- Snapshots, using the Chandy-Lamport or another algorithm
- Membership Changes (ยง6 of the Raft paper and ยง4 of the dissertation)
- Log Compaction (ยง7 of the Raft paper and ยง5 of the dissertation)
- Web application to control and interface with a Raft node (using gRPC)
- compare to hashicorp & etcd implementation 
- compare my implementationt to this blog post: https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2020/implementing-raft-part-0-introduction/
